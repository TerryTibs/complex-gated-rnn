A Metacognitive Neuro-Symbolic Network implemented in PyTorch. Built upon a Complex-Valued Recurrent (CV-RNN) backbone, this architecture integrates Hierarchical Vector Quantization (VQ) to discretize continuous latent states into interpretable Symbols and Concepts. Key features include Metacognitive Attention (memory of past thought-steps), Stochastic Recursive Depth (adaptive computation), and Invariance Training to enforce latent stability and structural coherence.
